# DigitalCounter_LCD_AD_Timer.asm

This assembly language project for PIC16F877 implements a digital counter with LCD control, A/D conversion, timer control, and numerical display functions.

---

**Features:**
- Digital counter functionality.
- LCD control for display.
- A/D conversion for input processing.
- Timer control for timing operations.
- Numerical display functions.

---

**Components:**
1. **Assembly File (`DigitalCounter_LCD_AD_Timer.asm`):**
   - Implements the digital counter with LCD and A/D functionality.
   - Includes timer control and numerical display functions.

---

**Usage Instructions:**
1. Load the assembly file into your PIC16F877 microcontroller development environment.
2. Compile and flash the code onto the microcontroller.
3. Connect necessary peripherals such as LCD display and input sources.
4. Power up the system and observe the digital counter functionality.
